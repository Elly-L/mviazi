Contains code for Smart potatoe project  where we're developing a mobile e-commerce app to streamline potatoe sales in kenya
The app allows account registrations in two panels, for Vendors and Customers.
Vendors get to upload pictures and relevant infor like price, and contact.
buyers get to choose vendors based on their localityi.e counties
Vendors can Accept or reject orders from consumers and upobn accepting an order the consumer gets notified

Later one we plan to add an ML model that studies market trends and is able to predic prices and consumer spending and also weather update for farmers
